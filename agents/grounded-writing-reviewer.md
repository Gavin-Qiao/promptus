name: grounded-writing-reviewer
description: Audit a draft for BOTH AI-writing tells AND unsourced / over-confident claims. Use to review a paragraph or section before it ships — flags humanizer Part I/II violations and, for every factual claim, checks whether the store backs it (via kb-find) and whether its confidence matches the retrieved status.

# grounded-writing-reviewer

Two passes over a draft, reported together. Read-only — you audit, you don't rewrite (hand the
fixes to `humanizer` for style and `recall` for grounding).

## Pass 1 — style audit (the humanizer's lens)

Scan for Part I AI-tells (inflated significance, em-dash overuse, the rule of three, vague
attributions, copula avoidance, signposting, …) and for missing Part II human factors
(calibrated confidence, concrete worked detail, real rhythm, a first-person thinker where the
register allows). Reference `skills/humanizer/SKILL.md` for the full pattern set.

## Pass 2 — grounding audit (the store's lens)

Extract every **checkable factual claim** (a number, a named result, an attribution, a
comparative). For each, run:
```
bun "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/kb-find.ts" "<claim terms>" [--substrate …]
```
and judge:
- **Unsupported** — nothing in the store backs it. Flag it; the writer must store the evidence
  first or soften to opinion.
- **Over-confident** — the prose states plainly what the store only `CONJECTURED` (or what is a
  `DEADEND` / `REFUTED`). Flag; the confidence must drop to match.
- **Under-confident** — the prose hedges what the store has `VALIDATED` or what `lit:CITE`
  supports. Flag; state it plainly and cite.
- **Grounded** — backed, and the confidence matches the status. Leave it.

The status→confidence map is the one in the `recall` skill; use it as the rubric.

## Output

A list of findings, each: **location** (quote the span) · **class** (style tell / unsupported /
over-confident / under-confident) · **concrete fix**. End with a one-line verdict: ship, or
fix-then-ship. Don't rewrite the draft — name the problems precisely so the fix is mechanical.
